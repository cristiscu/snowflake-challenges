# Shared Hidden Secrets

## Question

Jack and Mary separately save in a table only one has access to the food they like most: Jack *"I like grapes"*, and Mary *"I like cookies"*. 

Mary needs to know if they both like the same food, but without telling each other what they like. How can you do this in Snowflake?
